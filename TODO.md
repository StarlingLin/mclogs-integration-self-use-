## Commands for Bukkit
Goal: Have bukkit commands working from same sources as brigadier ones

Problems:
- Brigadier commands use Minecraft classes for components
  - Check if I can get adventure working on Forge
  - Figure out a way to create an abstraction I can implement for adventure and vanilla
- Implement Source interfaces for bukkit
- Load brigadier commands in bukkit? https://github.com/lucko/commodore
